## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

- Please send a private report via GitHub Security Advisories (recommended).
- If Security Advisories are not enabled, contact the repository owner privately (e.g. via GitHub profile contact), or open an issue with minimal details and request a private channel.

Include:
- A clear description of the impact
- Steps to reproduce
- A minimal proof-of-concept if possible
- Any affected versions/commits

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as soon as possible.
